## Project report

I think I finished the task. I made the needed controllers and domains for the exercise and gave it the functionality it needed.
The relevant files for this task is located in src/main/java/com/example/demo/controllers and src/main/java/com/example/demo/domain.
There were some issues with making tests as I did not manage to make the redirect correctly to the URL due to some encoding in how
the URL is passed. Thus there are some scenarios that are not being tested, such as a user changing their vote or deleting a poll.

Other than that I do believe I solved the task if I managed to understand the assignment description correctly. I do think that when
the program runs that the REST API is setup to work in the manner that is inteded from the description and that the only issue is with testing
the different functionalities
