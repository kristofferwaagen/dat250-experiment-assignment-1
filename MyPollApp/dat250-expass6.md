## Exercise 3 report

- Technical problems that I encountered during the completion of the tutorial

  - There were some issues knowing if I did the tasks correctly and knowing if the solution I made works as intended. Furthermore there were issues when trying to use CORS, I do not know why, but it did not work at all until i closed the server and ran it again. I think it was due to cookies, but have no clue.

- A link to my code for experiments 1-2

  - Here is the URL for experiment 1: https://github.com/kristofferwaagen/dat250-experiment-assignments/tree/85019216d1e62d7c15e88f74c01170b646e011fd
  - Here is the URL for experiment 2: https://github.com/kristofferwaagen/dat250-experiment-assignments/tree/326b5dd837145a7ad6af503394fc61faf8f7cec5

- Any pending issues with this assignment which I did not manage to solve

  - I do not think there are any issues that I have not resolved in this task. Other than user friendly solutions such as refreshing the created poll or having a login feature. These might be added in the future, but based upon the assignment description. The only issue is with the tests because I don't think I managed to make them correctly.
